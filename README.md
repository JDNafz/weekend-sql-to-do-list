# Full Stack To-Do List App:

## Description

_Duration: 14 hour Sprint_

The weekend coding challenge was to create a full-stack to-do list web app.

## Description & Approach


I like to take the description of the requirements and read it through once to get a general idea of the project. Next I read it again, creating a to-do list of the major features that need to be implemented. I like to visualize all the little moving parts before starting, so from there I write out the linking pieces that are needed for each of the major features.

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Express 
- 'PG'
- Postico

## Installation
1. Fork and clone this repository for your own access.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Use the database.sql file to initialize your `weekend-to-do-app` database with a table (optionally a few example entries).
4. Run `npm start` in your terminal
5. Go to http://localhost:5000/ 

## Usage
Keep track of your to-do list items.
 1. Enter your task and hit enter or click submit
 2. Check the box next to tasks to mark them complete.
 3. Delete entries that are no longer needed.

## Developer Notes

This project was satisfying to work through and a new challenge to expand my front end knowledge to start making use of bootstrap and minimal SCSS. I look forward to learning more and developing more specific styling options. In the future if I'm able to dedicate more time to this project I would love to implement more modules for some of the calculations of time, and further develop the timestamp feature to neatly include the date.
