## Description & Approach


I like to take the description of the requirements and read it through once to get a general idea of the project. Next I read it again, creating a to-do list of the major features that need to be implemented. I like to visualize all the little moving parts before starting, so from there I write out the linking pieces that are needed for each of the major features.
